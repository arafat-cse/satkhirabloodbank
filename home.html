	<p>STORAGE OF BLOOD

The collected Whole Blood is spun in a centrifuge to separate it into different components. The packed Red Blood Cells (RBC) are refrigerated with an anti-coagulant solution (CPDA-1) to extend shelf life to 35 days. The less dense blood plasma is made into fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets and is labeled accordingly based on the products. The plasma is frozen promptly within 6 hours of collection and labelled as Fresh Frozen Plasma; it is stored at –30°C or colder for one year.

The platelets are stored in an incubator at 20-24°C temperature with agitation, and have a shelf life of five days. Since they are stored at room temperature, they are at high risk for growing bacteria. So we are routinely doing quality checks which include blood count, pH and culture. We are preserving Whole Blood for up to 35 days, maintaining its usefulness in blood transfusions with an anti-coagulant (CPDA-1).

WHO NEEDS BLOOD TRANSFUSION?

Thousands of patients need blood transfusions like patients suffering from hemorrhage due to casualties, surgical procedures, pregnancy; hemophilic patients; patients suffering from chronic anemia and malignancy; thalassemia patients; patients who have had organ transplantation, neonatal jaundice and others. Further, emergency occurs every second. We need to be prepared to face any kind of adversities natural as well as man-made. Apollo Blood Bank wishes that nobody needs blood by God’s grace, but for those who need blood, we prove to be a life saver. Donating blood is the noblest gift one can offer and we provide a connecting link between the donor and the receiver. </p>
